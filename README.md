Answers to select exercises from
[*The Go Programming Language* book](http://www.gopl.io/).

Exercises that only consist of a single file of source code
can be run with `go run chx-*/ex.y.go`.

In several cases, the exercises involve modifying the sample
programs in the book. The source code for these sample
programs can be found [here](https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io).
